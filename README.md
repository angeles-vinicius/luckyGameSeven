This is a simple game made in Visual Basic just to have fun!
Tool:
  Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community (free version)
  .net Framework

  My work here here is a simulation of a 3-slot slot machine
  where if any number 7 is drawn in the range of 1 to 10,
  a prize figure is displayed and a sound is emitted.
